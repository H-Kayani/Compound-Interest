# Compound-Interest

Develop  a program for prospective customers to show them how their savings could grow over time.
The  idea  behind  compound  interest  is  that  the  interest  you  earn  each  year  is  added  to  your principal (starting amount), 
so that the balance doesn't just grow, it grows at an increasing rate. This is one of the most useful concepts in finance. 
It is the basis of everything from personal saving plans to long term growth in the stock market and accounts for the effects of inflation. 
It is thought to have originated in the 17th century and can be thought of as ‘interest on interest’.
